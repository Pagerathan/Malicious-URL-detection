> # MALWARE DETECTION USING FEATURE PREDICTION

***

- Developed a malware detection system to predict which feature will result in the file most likely being malicious or not.
- Implemented standardization of data to help in feature extraction using CNN and categorisation.
- Found the suitable algorithm for the given dataset ( data had some noise which may result in overfitting ) by implementing various methods KNN, Random Forest in classification.
- Used Random forest in learning algorithm as it resulted in the graph having maximum detection rate and lowest false positive rate.
